## Computer Graphics with JavaScript in the browser

### Using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- the language
  - a scripting language, which is [interpretted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation)
  - follows specifications laid out by the [ECMA](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4269188) standards
  - where is JavaScript used? different scripts in different contexts..
- the context
  - for this series, alongside a document created with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)
  - this document is rendered using a browser..
- the [browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) (our JavaScript runtime)
  - the browser maintains an engine that dictates how to interpret the JavaScript
    - with respect to the document
    - this is how a lot of modern web pages come together
  - an environment that knows what JavaScript is and how to execute it

### Introduction to the Canvas API (using JavaScript)
- This is the way we'll draw things using JavaScript code
- An [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) is just a user interface.. but for code
  - you have your own code, and someone else has written code that you would like to use
  - if they create an API, you can use their code easily enough through the interface they make

#### the Canvas
- adding the element to the document
  - start with a new [document using html](./canvas.html)
  - a basic [template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage#a_skeleton_template) can get us started quickly
    - my version is modified for simplicity
  - notice the canvas tag `<canvas></canvas>` within the `<body></body>` tag
- the line below is JavaScript code, and is used to reference the canvas in the document
```JavaScript
var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');
```

#### conceptualizing the grid
- canvas is an x-y coordinate plane
  - can visualize this by drawing rectangles
  - create a grid

- draw rectangles, reference canvas pixel area
  - using strokes, concept of outline
  - using fills, concept of filled shape

#### creating paths, lines, curves, arcs
- produce paths/segments/curves originating from one point and going to another

#### using color
- coloring the paths and curves we created

### programmatic approach to drawing
- leveraging JavaScript to reduce the implementation for our approach
  - functions
  - loops
- use these techniques to procedurally generate more curves, starting from more points

## Next time
- using a library to simplify our code, prototype more quickly
