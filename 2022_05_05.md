## Computer Graphics with JavaScript in the browser

### Using JavaScript
- the browser (runtime)
- the language
- the context (document created with HTML)

### Introduction to the Canvas API (using JavaScript)
- briefly, an API is..

#### the Canvas
- adding the element to the document
  - using HTML to do so
- referencing the canvas in js

#### conceptualizing the grid
- canvas is an x-y coordinate plane
  - can visualize this by drawing rectangles
  - create a grid

- draw rectangles, reference canvas pixel area
  - using strokes, concept of outline
  - using fills, concept of filled shape

#### creating paths, lines, curves, arcs
- produce paths/segments/curves originating from one point and going to another

#### using color
- coloring the paths and curves we created

### programmatic approach to drawing
- leveraging JavaScript to reduce the implementation for our approach
  - functions
  - loops
- use these techniques to procedurally generate more curves, starting from more points

## Next time
- using a library to simplify our code, prototype more quickly
